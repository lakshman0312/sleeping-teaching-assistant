## Abstract
During regular office hours, a teaching assistant (TA) in a university computer science department assists undergraduate students with their programming assignments. The TA's office is relatively modest, with only one desk, a chair, and a computer. If the TA is currently assisting another student, students can sit in the hallway outside the office on one of three chairs. When there are no students in need of assistance during office hours, the TA sits at the desk and falls asleep. If a student arrives during office hours and discovers the TA asleep, the student must rouse the TA and request assistance. If a student arrives and finds the TA currently assisting another student, the student sits in the hallway on one of the seats and waits. If there are no chairs available, the student will return at a later time. The code that coordinates the TA's and students' actions is written in POSIX threads, mutex locks, and semaphores.
## Introduction
Multithreading is a powerful technology that allows programmes to accomplish numerous tasks at the same time, enhancing performance and resource utilisation. However, managing shared resources and guaranteeing thread synchronisation becomes critical to preserve consistency and avoid conflicts. A teaching assistant's (TA) job is critical in providing academic help to pupils. In this project, we imitate a TA's office where students visit to seek assistance. The office has a limited number of waiting chairs, and the TA can only serve one student at a time. If all of the seats are taken, the student must wait outside until one becomes available.
